# katakana.js

Copy and paste this into your JavaScript console:

```
ウ=ホ=[],ア=!!ホ+ホ,ネ=!ホ+ホ,テ=ホ+{}
ヌ=ア[+ホ],セ=ア[ミ=++ウ],ハ=++ミ+ウ
ヘ=テ[ミ+ハ],サ=ヘ+テ[ウ]+(ホ.ホ+ホ)[ウ
]+ネ[ハ]+ヌ+セ+ア[ミ]+ヘ+ヌ+テ[ウ]+セ
サ[サ][サ](ネ[ウ]+ネ[ミ]+ア[ハ]+セ+ヌ+"()")()
```

The minified source is currently 144 chars.

I could need some help to get it down to @140bytes!
